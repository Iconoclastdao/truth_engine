## What is This System?

This project provides a transparent, step-by-step logging and tracing system for both cryptographic and AI computation pipelines.  
It is designed for researchers, auditors, and developers who need to:

- Understand and audit model behavior at every layer (tokenization, embedding, transformer, decoding)
- Trace cryptographic operations (SHA256, Ed25519, AES, Keccak, etc.)
- Reproduce and verify computations with cryptographically signed logs
- Coordinate entropy and randomness in a verifiable way (for cryptography and AI sampling)

---

## How Does It Work?

### 1. Modular Computation Flows

**AI/LLM Flow:**

- Input text is tokenized, embedded, passed through transformer layers, and decoded.
- Each step is logged with input/output, metadata, and cryptographic hashes.
- Supports Hugging Face models (e.g., GPT-2).

**Cryptographic Flow:**

- Data passes through hash, signature, encryption, and other crypto primitives.
- Each operation is logged and can be reversed or mimicked for audit purposes.

### 2. Transparent Logging

- Every step in the pipeline is recorded as a signed log entry.
- Logs include operation type, input/output (base64), metadata, and cryptographic hashes.
- Logs can be exported for external audit or reproducibility.

### 3. Entropy Coordination

- Commitment and reveal mechanisms for entropy/sampling (for both crypto and AI).
- Ensures that randomness and sampling are auditable and not manipulated.

### 4. Reversibility and Mimicry

- Many operations can be reversed or mimicked, enabling input reconstruction and what-if analysis.

## Example Usage

**Run an LLM flow:**

```bash
python llm_flow.py --input "Hello, world!" --model-name distilgpt2 --num-layers 2
```
Run a cryptographic flow:
```bash

python tcc_flow.py --input "test" --aes-key <32 hex chars> --ed25519-key <64 hex chars>
```
See all options:
```bash
python llm_flow.py --help
python tcc_flow.py --help
```

Typical Applications

AI/ML Research:
Trace and audit every step of LLM inference for transparency and debugging.

Security & Compliance:
Provide cryptographic proof of computation steps for audits or regulatory requirements.

Reproducible Science:
Guarantee that results can be independently verified with full logs.

# üåê API Usage (FastAPI Server)

A full-featured FastAPI server is included to execute **Sheeva** (TCC) and **Aivail** (LLM) flows via HTTP.

## üîß Running the API Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Note:
Ensure main.py contains your FastAPI app and the correct import paths for Sheeva and Aivail.

üì° Endpoints Overview
